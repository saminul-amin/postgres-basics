### **üåø The Ranger and the Rare Animal**

Meera is a forest ranger who protects wildlife in a nature reserve. She‚Äôs searching for the rare **Shadow Leopard** , which hasn‚Äôt been seen in months. To help track sightings and share data with scientists, she uses a simple database with three tables: **`rangers`**, **`species`**, and **`sightings`**. These help her log observations, learn about endangered animals, and find clues about rare animals like the Shadow Leopard might be hiding.

## **üìú Assignment Objective**

This assignment focuses on **PostgreSQL database operations** using a real-world scenario in **wildlife conservation monitoring**. You will create and manage three tables (`rangers`, `species`, `sightings`), insert sample data, and perform essential SQL queries including:

- **CRUD operations**
- **Constraints (PK, FK, CHECK, DEFAULT)**
- **JOINs**
- **Aggregations (`COUNT`, `MAX`, etc.)**
- **Filtering (`WHERE`, `HAVING`)**
- **Data manipulation (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`) etc**

This assignment reinforces your understanding of relational databases while engaging with an environmental use case.

## **üìÇ Database Setup**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install PostgreSQL** on your system if not already installed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open **pgAdmin** or your preferred PostgreSQL terminal.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a new database** named `"conservation_db"` or any appropriate name.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Connect** to the newly created database.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Write PostgreSQL queries to solve given problems.

## **üìÇ Table Details**

## üß± The 3 Main Tables `Meera` Uses:
```markdown
| Table Name  | What It Stores                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rangers`   | Information about rangers like Meera (name, contact, zone)                    |
| `species`   | Info about different animals (name, scientific name, how endangered they are) |
| `sightings` | Records of when and where each animal was seen                                |
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `rangers`

```markdown
| Field Name  | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `ranger_id` | Unique ID for each ranger |
| `name`      | Full name of the ranger   |
| `region`    | Area they patrol          |
```
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `species`

```markdown
| Field Name            | Description                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `species_id`          | Unique ID for each species             |
| `common_name`         | Common name (e.g., "Shadow Leopard")   |
| `scientific_name`     | Scientific name                        |
| `discovery_date`      | When the species was first recorded    |
| `conservation_status` | Status like "Endangered", "Vulnerable" |
```
> ‚úÖ discovery_date helps track when a species was officially identified.
>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `sightings`

```markdown
| Field Name      | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `sighting_id`   | Unique ID for each sighting                |
| `ranger_id`     | Who made the sighting (links to `rangers`) |
| `species_id`    | Which animal was seen (links to `species`) |
| `sighting_time` | Date and time of the sighting              |
| `location`      | Where it was seen                          |
| `notes`         | Additional observations (optional)         |
```

> ‚úÖ sighting_time tracks when an animal was seen ‚Äî very useful for monitoring wildlife activity.
